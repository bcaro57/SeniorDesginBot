# SeniorDesignBot
This repo is the brains behind the robot for Team 123's Senior Design Project, the low cost mobile agriculture robot!

Each of the files that you see were created using PlatformIO on Visual Studio Code, which means that the actual code that we ran is in the /src/main.cpp file for each program.
